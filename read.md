## Game Overview

**LABRINTH** is a terminal-based maze game where you navigate through a labyrinth filled with enemies that chase you based on simple movement logic. The game offers three difficulty levels, a scoreboard system, and the ability to customize the maze map. Though inspired by Pacman, the gameplay is distinct, providing a fresh take on the maze genre.

1. Objective:

   Your goal is to navigate throught the challenging maze, gather all the Diamonds '♦', reveal the Tresure '$', and reach it in order to win the game.
   But, be careful because there are wild Gnomes '¤' lurking and big Traals '£'. Don't let them catch you because they will eat you.

2. Controls:

   Use the arrow keys to move your character '@'.

3. Difficulties

   The game has 3 level difficulties, Easy, Medium and Hard.

## Features

- **Three Difficulty Levels**: Choose between Easy, Medium, and Hard modes to match your skill level.
- **Customizable Map**: Modify the map by editing a text file to create your own custom labyrinth.
- **Scoreboard**: The game saves your high scores in a binary file, so you can keep track of your progress.
- **Simple Enemy AI**: Enemies use basic movement logic, with potential for future enhancement to more advanced AI.
- **Windows Terminal Support**: Designed exclusively for Windows Terminal, ensuring optimal performance on this platform.

## Technologies Used

- **C++**: The core programming language used for developing the game.
- **PDCurses Library**: Handles the graphical rendering in the terminal.
- **Windows Terminal**: The platform required to run the game.

## Installation

To install and play **LABRINTH** on your Windows system, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/keleviss/labrinth
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd labrinth
   ```

4. **Run the game**:
   Execute/Run the game `LABRINTH.exe` as an "Admin"
   

## Usage

- **Starting the Game**: Launch the game by executing the compiled `.exe` file as an *Administrator*.
- **Selecting Game Mode**: Choose from Easy, Medium, or Hard modes.
- **Scoreboard**: Your scores are saved in the `scoreboard.bin` file located in the `gamefiles` folder.
- **Custom Maps**: Edit the `map.txt` file in the `gamefiles` folder to create and play with custom maps.

## Game Modes

**LABRINTH** offers three distinct game modes:

1. **Easy**: Slower enemy speed and more lives, suitable for beginners.
2. **Medium**: A balanced challenge with moderate enemy speed.
3. **Hard**: Fast-paced and difficult, with quicker enemies and fewer lives.

## Custom Maps

The game map is stored in a `map.txt` file in the `gamefiles` folder. You can create custom maps by modifying this file, following the structure of the existing map. Please note that custom maps have not been extensively tested; report any issues you encounter.

## Potential Improvements

While the game currently uses basic movement logic for enemies (implemented through nested `if` statements), there is potential to enhance the gameplay by incorporating more advanced algorithms for enemy AI. This could include pathfinding algorithms like A* to make enemies smarter and more challenging.
